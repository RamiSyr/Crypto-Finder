Script with interface, searches  on all internal and external drives for hundreds of files that can be created by different kind of ransomware. Actually, searches for 200+ different ransomwares and their notes and encrypted files extensions.

The script runs as Admin by itself to insure that it will have access to search everywhere.<br>
It has ListView in his body, which will display the result of the scan after the scan done. <br>
Two controls on each found file in this ListView: <br>
- Double click on each item in the list will open the container folder.
- Left Click will delete the file if we click YES on the confirmation message.
<br>
The scan may take up to 5 minutes to scan 100GB of data on a normal quality computer.
<br>
