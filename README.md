Script with interface, searches for hundreds of files that can be created by different kind of ransomware. actually, searches for 150+ different ransomwares and 250+ ransomware notes and extensions.

The script runs as Admin by itself to insure that it will have access to search everywhere.
It has ListView in his body, which will display the result of the scan after the scan done. With tow controls on each found file in this ListView:
- Double click on each item in the list will open the container folder.
- Left Click will delete the file if we click YES on the confirmation message.

After running “Crypto Finder” a text file will be created in the same script’s folder, this txt file calls: CryptoFinderSearchResult.txt, and it contains a list of all files that being found by line, or empty if nothing has found.

The scan may take up to 5 minutes to scan 100GB of data on a normal quality computer.
