Script with interface, searches for hundreds of files that can be created by different kind of ransomware. actually, searches for 170+ different ransomwares and 300+ ransomware notes and extensions.

The script runs as Admin by itself to insure that it will have access to search everywhere.
It has ListView in his body, which will display the result of the scan after the scan done. With tow controls on each found file in this ListView:
- Double click on each item in the list will open the container folder.
